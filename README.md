# Positive-Book-Sentiment-Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment (positive/negative) of book reviews. This project involves a series of assignments aimed at data analysis, problem formulation, project planning, and model implementation.

The dataset, which exhibited a well-balanced distribution of positive and negative reviews, underwent thorough preprocessing. This included the removal of stopwords and an exploratory analysis, yielding insights into frequently used terms within the reviews. To achieve precise sentiment prediction, we employed two powerful machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. The SVM model was fine-tuned through a grid search for optimal hyperparameters, while the Random Forest classifier was configured with 100 decision trees. Model performance was rigorously assessed using accuracy metrics and classification reports, providing valuable insights into the sentiment of book reviews.
